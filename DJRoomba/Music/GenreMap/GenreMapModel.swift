/// - `ordinary`: a regular stop — the existing Phase-1 pill.
/// - `junction`: a pill with a `diamond.fill` glyph inside it — modest
///   topological breadth, AND not necessarily a strand member (the
///   classification is layout-graph-derived, not strand-derived).
/// - `transferStation`: a pill that serves 2+ metro strands. From
///   Phase 3 the signal is communicated **purely via the per-strand
///   coloured tick row under the pill** — the Phase-2 neutral multi-
///   strand glyph is removed (it was a placeholder for the strand
///   colours that didn't exist yet).

///   per-node mutual-kNN ∪ maximum spanning tree ∪ strongest inter-
///   community bridges. The display knows about more edges (kept on each
///   node for future hover-reveal) but they never enter the force kernel.
